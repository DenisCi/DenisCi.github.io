   <p>According to SHOWstudio's youtube video, "Thoughts on Fashion Film," Nick Knight believes the internet is the best medium 
       in which to portray fashion, as it is widely acessible and can show movement, which can better show what the designer 
       intended when creating the piece. Knight says that this is why he created SHOWstudio; to give a platform to fashion film.
       When creating an image or a film for fashion, Knight says that he doesn't have to create a narrative for it because it is 
       already there, and that great fashion already takes into account aspects like color, juxtaposition, shapes, and historical
       reference.

       Kanye West, Travis Scott, and Lady Gaga. His work has been shown at numerous exhibits around the world. He was given an
       honorary Ph.D by the University of the Arts in London, where he is also an honorary professor. In 2010 he was awarded with
       an OBE (Officer in the Order of the British Empire) award for his contributions in the Arts.

       According to Vogue, Nick Knight is known for "pushing boundaries technically and creatively at every opportunity and being 
       at the forefront of innovation." A common theme in his work is "to empower and show solidarity within minority groups."
       His works have also challenged conventional ideals of beauty by showing women who don't fit these conventional ideals.
