   <p>Nicholas David Gordon Knight, known professionally as Nick Knight, was born on the 24th of November, 1958, in Hammersmith, 
       London, England. His Father was a psychologist, his mother was a physiotherapist, and his brother was a chemist. Initially 
       Knight was interested going to pursue a Biology degree, but he didn't find the subject interesting. Instead, he studied
       photography, which he had liked since he was a teen. He studied at the Bournemouth & Poole College of Art and Design. His first
       photography book, "Skinhead," was published by i-D magazines in 1982, and in 1996 it won the Designers and Art Directors 
       Award for Best Book Cover. In 1993, Knight took a break from the fashion world and worked with David Chipperfield, an 
       architect, to make "Power Plant," a gallery at the Natural History Museum located in London, which "explores the 
       relationship between people and plants." Later that same year he returned to fashion photography. He has since worked with many
       designers and companies to create many different images and films. In 2000, he started
       SHOWstudio, a website dedicated to fashion film. He lives with his wife, Charlotte Knight and their three children in
       Petersham, a suburb outside of London, in 2 houses that David Chipperfield designed for him. In 2016, Knight shot the 
       portraits of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles for the Queen's 90th birthday.
