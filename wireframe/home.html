       <p>Hello recruit. This is your final test before you can become a full-fledged detective!<br>
        We think the murderer may have left behind some clues in the victim's apartment.<br>
        We need you to go inside and see what you can find!<br>
        Don't worry about the power outage, You have your flashlight. <br>
        This task will require sharp observation skills, recruit. <br>
        You'll only have a very short window of time to look around once you enter, so be quick!
      </p>
