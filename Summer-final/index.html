    <div class="textBox" style="top: 300px;"> <!--Paragraph 1: Intro-->
        <p>Summer was always my favorite season. After every year here in the United States, I would go back to Romania to relax, connect with my roots, and spend time with the family and friends that live there. After spending nine months in school, I'm always mentally exhausted and drained of motivation. Walking around New York City has been a hobby of mine since I started college, and it helps re-energize me for the next few days. But just walking around here on my own can't take all my mental fatigue away, no matter how breathtaking the city can be. </p>

        <p> On the other hand, going back to Romania always gave me long term motivation. It was like replacing a dead battery with a new one. I don't know exactly what causes such a drastic improvement. It could be the more laid back culture, the reduced stress, the language, the food, or most likely a combination of all these factors. During the summer of 2019, which feels like decades ago now, I got to visit more parts of Romania that I'd never seen before. I took this photo on a back alley in Cluj, one of the county's largest cities. I can't wait to be able to have social gatherings on this scale again. </p>

        <p>Due to Covid19, I couldn't go to Romania last summer. I thought that maybe I could still get that recharge here, since I had some new games I'd been dying to play and I could finally spend a summer with my friends from Ohio. But I was being dumb. Even though all of us would always wear masks and spent most of our time at home, because of our fear of potentially getting and spreading Covid, we only met up as a group on 2 occasions all summer, both times when we were sure we were safe. Aside from that, I also went to a natural park nearby with my sister, which was the most exciting thing I did all summer. I really enjoyed it, but spending the other 90% of my time indoors during the warmest days of the year definitely makes me feel like this most recent summer was a net negative.</p>

        <p> During the second to last week of August 2020, I fianlly got to visit Washington D.C again. I've visited D.C before with my middle school, but being on a guided tour and on a tight schedule doesn't exactly facilitate exploration. So this time it was nice to be able to actually go around and see all of the places I'd wanted to see. Though again, Covid19 made it a lot harder to enjoy the experience. There were tons of people without masks out and about, and Trump's then-recent rally encouraged more of his supporters to put themselves and others in danger. Then I had to leave D.C the next day, because I had to pack my things and move back to NYC. Summer was already over and despite each individual day seeming like it lasted forever, the entire summer felt like a blur at the end.</p>

        <p> Even though we're still far from being finished with Covid, at least we can now see the finish line. And, I hope I'm not jinxing it by saying this, but I really hope we can have a normal summer again in 2021. If that ends up happening, there's a particular place I want to visit again. Balea Lake in Romania. It's a glacial lake that formed on top of a mountain, and the serpentine road up the mountain leading to it is reputed to be one of the most beautiful in the world. This place is special to me because my father used to drive us up here from time to time when he was still alive. On my most recent visit,, I managed to take this photo while on the way up, which has remained one of my all time favorites. And not long after this, I got the opportunity to see both a massive hydroelectric dam and a beach that I'd been thinking of going to for years. I can only hope that future summers will be as amazing as that one.</p>
