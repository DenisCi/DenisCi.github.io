     <h1>Week 3</h1>
       <h2>As We May Think</h2>
       <h4>by Vannevar Bush</h4>
   <p>In "As we May Think," Vannevar Bush correctly predicts a number of the technologies that we've incorporated into our
       daily lives. When he wrote this article in 1945, the majority of these technologies were 30 or 40 years away. And although
       he doesn't perfectly capture how these technologies are used or the exact logistics of how they function, he predicts both
       the general structures of many technologies and their everyday uses. He correctly predicted: Microcameras, <i>(though we use them
       on our phones and not on our foreheads)</i> speech to text, massive logic systems compressed into tiny spaces, massive file
       storage and retrieval capabilities on small devices, web-based libraries and directories done through pages and links, <i> (this 
       one was prettty much spot-on)</i> and even the profession of web development. And this is decades prior to the first webpage
       being a thing. On top of being a genius at predicting future tech, Bush also proves to be very aware of the society around 
       him and the way in which it was progressing. He writes that "mechanization may yet force the issue, especially in the scientific
       field; whereupon scientific jargon would become still less intelligible to the layman." <b>This statement has become more and more
       true.</b> Today, the average citizen couldn't tell you jack squat about how the technologies they use every day function.
       Bush also points out that science has let people point "throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons." While
       Bush was likely referring to bombs and other physical weapons when he wrote this, today it could have a new meaning. Because
       social media platforms have been used to polarize people and cause or accelerate conflict.

   <h2>Long Live the Web</h2>
   <h4>by Tim Berners-Lee</h4>
   <p> In "Long Live the Web," Tim Berners-Lee discusses the key principles that the Web adheres to, and how in modern times
       these principles (Universality, Open Standards, Division of Layers, Electronic Human Rights, and Privacy, according to 
       Berners-Lee) are either being trampled on or otherwise disregarded by corporations (like Facebook) or governments. 
       Berners-Lee states that Universality is important because it is what lets us freely interact with all parts of the web. 
       In situations like with Itunes, that part of the web becomes "walled off." Which many companies are trying to do for their 
       own benefit. Also, Berner-Lee highlighted the net neutrality issue of large internet providers throttling internet speed
       for services unassociated with them. This was long before Ajit Pai and his Verizon overlords decided to cut away all pretense
       of neutrality in 2018. Though Pai claimed no one would get slower or throttled internet as a result, <b> we all know it happens.</b>
